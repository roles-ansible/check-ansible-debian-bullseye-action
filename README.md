 Check Ansible Debian stable
=======================
This action allows you to test your ansible role or your playbook in a Docker Container with ``debian:stable``.

## Usage
To use the action simply create an ``ansible-debian-stable.yml`` *(or choose custom ``*.yml`` name)* in the ``.github/workflows/`` directory.

For example:

```yaml
name: Ansible check debian:stable  # feel free to pick your own name

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Important: This sets up your GITHUB_WORKSPACE environment variable
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: ansible check with debian:stable
      # replace "master" with any valid ref
      uses: roles-ansible/check-ansible-debian-stable-action@master
      with:
        targets: "./"
        # [required]
        # Paths to your ansible role or playboox.yml you want to test
        # Some Examples:
        # targets: "role/my_role/"
        # targets: "site.yml"
```

Alternatively, you can run the ansible check only on certain branches:

```yaml

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - stable
    - release/v*
```

or on various [events](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows)
